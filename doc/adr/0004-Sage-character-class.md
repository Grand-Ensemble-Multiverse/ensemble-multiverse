# 4. Introduction of Sage Character Class

**Status:** Proposed  
**Date:** 2025-11-14  

## Context
The RPG system currently includes classes such as Detectives, Healers, Pilots and Technicians. Sages are a new class that emphasizes intellectual mastery, ethical guidance, and hybrid tech-magic abilities.

## Decision
Replace the **Druid** class with a **Sage** class. The Sage will serve as a knowledge-focused archetype, drawing power from archives, AI remnants, and predictive logic rather than nature. This aligns better with the post-collapse, orbital society setting and supports advanced quest mechanics involving lore recovery and ethical dilemmas.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Enhances narrative consistency with the futuristic setting.
- Introduces unique gameplay mechanics (predictive abilities, tech-magic hybrid skills).
- Creates new quest opportunities tied to knowledge preservation and ethical decision-making.

### Negative
- Requires rebalancing of existing skill trees and progression paths.
- Some nature-based lore elements will need to be deprecated or repurposed.

## Alternatives Considered
- Retain Druids and add Sages as a separate class (rejected due to redundancy and lore conflict).
- Modify Druids to incorporate tech elements (rejected as it dilutes the original concept and lacks thematic clarity).

## Implementation Notes
- Develop **Sage ability tree** with tiers: Novice → Archivist → Oracle.
- Integrate faction lore: Council of Continuity.
- Update quest generation logic to include knowledge-based objectives.
