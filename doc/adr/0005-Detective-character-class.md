# 5. Detective character class

## Context
Set 800 years in the future, 300 years after an ecological collapse, most people live in orbital habitats governed by Military Space Command. Earth has reverted to a medieval society. Each habitat employs civilian, unarmed detectives who report to the Mayor and Space Commissioner. Detectives are central to narrative-driven investigations, using diplomacy, logic, and resourcefulness in a technocratic, non-dystopian society.

## Decision
Add a Detective character class, available as a playable role or NPC, with these features:

### Primary Function
Investigation, diplomacy, and intelligence gathering.

### Core Skills
- Forensic analysis (digital and physical evidence)
- Negotiation and persuasion
- Limited cybersecurity and hacking
- Knowledge of orbital law and inter-habitat protocols

## Consequences
- Increases complexity of skill trees and quest design
- Requires integration with dialogue systems and evidence-based gameplay
- Improves immersion and player engagement through non-combat problem-solving
